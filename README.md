comfortable call-logger for sailfish OS / just an self-educational project

I wrote this tiny app for my wife who missed a comfortable call logger in Sailfish OS and for whom the minimalistic
design of the system app was not satisfactory. For wannabe jolla developpers this app might of be interest is it shows 
many of the basic concepts in a very clear and simple way although many implementational details are surely not
optimal - I am just a hobbyist developper ... ;-)
